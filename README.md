Most useful pages do not include the keyword (that the users are looking for). The pages are not succificiently descriptive with various semantic mismatches. Ranking algorithm (PageRank) algorithm can be used to find the most authoritative pages for the given topic. This ranking algorithm can find the small set of the most authoritative pages that are relevant to the query. PageRank captures only a simplistic view of a network. HITS is a link-analysis algorithm for finding key pages that involves Authorities and Hubs each with its respective scores; authority score and hub score. An authority web page is one with good, authoritative content on a specific topic like NASA and other organizations for the topic search eclipse. Authorities are linked by many hubs. A simple search for topic "eclipse" on Yahoo or Google results in the display of NASA's website and other reliable authorities. A web page pointing to many authoritative web pages such as Yahoo, Google and other portal pages are hubs. Authorities and hubs have a mutual reinforcement relationship.
